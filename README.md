# rightvaluestest
Rightvalues is a quiz for the people on the right of the spectrum, based upon the LeftValues quiz that seeks to identify your position on the right-wing spectrum, as the alternative to LeftValues. If you are not a rightist, this quiz is obviously not suited for you, and you should look for the LeftValues instead. You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. This quiz is made by Github User 'rightvaluestest'.
