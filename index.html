<img src="img/allvalues.png" class="center" alt="The values being differentiated in this quiz" />
<p><b>Note: A newer version of the test that patches much of the problems in the current test is in progress.</b></p>
<h2>What is RightValues?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-answer">Rightvalues is a quiz for the people on the right of the spectrum, based upon the <a href="https://leftvalues.github.io/">LeftValues</a> quiz that seeks to identify your position on the right-wing spectrum, as the alternative to LeftValues. If you are not a rightist, this quiz is obviously not suited for you, and you should look for the LeftValues instead. You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the generic main test.</p>

<h2>What are the values?</h2>
  <p>There are currently six axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p>

<p><b style="color:#0c5199;">Reform</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#42c2f5;">Conserve</b> (Cultural)<br/>
        This is Liberal vs Conservative in other words. The Cultural Left is left-wing culturally, supporting things like LGBTQ rights and Abortion. The Cultural Right wants to preserve culture and usually do not support the legalization of weed or abortion.</p>

	<p><b style="color:#174f8a;">Intervention</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#c7c406;">Laissez-Faire</b> (Economic)<br/>
        Those with a higher Intervention score tend to want the government to regulate the economy. Those with a higher Laissez-Faire tend to reject such measures and value free-market economy. 

	<p><b style="color:#9403fc;">Dictatorship</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#1fa3c4;">Constitution</b> (Civil)<br/>
	Those with a higher dictatorship score tend to favour a dictator with less restrictions. Those who have a higher constitution score support a constitution, with the extreme having little to no government, but with a nation-wide constitution (NAP).
		
	<p><b style="color:#90bcd6;">Particular</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#7F3300;">Universal</b> (Diplomatic)<br/>
        Those with a higher particular score tend to want things as they are, and focus internally to avoid conflict. Those with a higher Universal score tend to want to topple corrupt regimes or nations, for reasons of benefiting the nation, or the benefit of the people internationally.</p>

	<p><b style="color:#d48817;">Theocracy</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#d1ccae;">Seperation</b> (Political Theism)<br/>
        Those with a higher Theocracy score tend to want a theocratic government, where religious organizations make political decisions. Those with a higher Seperation score tend to want a seperated Church from the state. This does not correlate to a person's religious beliefs.</p>

	<p><b style="color:#389cd1;">Decelerate</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#c4b631;">Accelerate</b> (Technological)<br/>
        Those with a higher Decelerate score tend to want a slower technological progress, and wants to conserve the current or past way of living. Those who score higher in Investment tend to think that acceleration brings many benefits to the market.</p>

	<p><b style="color:#27577A;">Race</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#C4A717;">Equality</b> (Societal)<br/>
        Those with a higher Race score think each race has different roles, strengths, and weaknesses. Those with a higher Equality score think race is not important, and we should see people at their character more than their race.</p>
	<br>
	

<h2>What does "Closest Match" mean in the results?</h2>
    <p>Similar to 8values, this quiz will attempt to match you with a specific rightist ideology. There are currently 36 ideologies, with more to come. Suggestions are very welcome. </p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-scores">Please remember that you are not intended to get a 100% score in any of the categories. The point of the quiz is to challenge your views. If you have any suggestions or constructive criticism please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/Puc4sjaSQqvwNu6q8">short form</a>.</p>

<h2>Official Release!</h2>
	<p>This will be updated, and if there are any errors, please tell me through this <a href="https://forms.gle/Puc4sjaSQqvwNu6q8">form</a> </p>
