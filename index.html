<h2 data-i18n="index-h2-whatis">What is RightValues?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-answer">Rightvalues is a quiz for the people on the right of the spectrum, based upon the <a href="https://leftvalues.github.io/">LeftValues</a> quiz that seeks to identify your position on the right-wing spectrum, as the alternative to LeftValues. If you are not a rightist, this quiz is obviously not suited for you, and you should look for the LeftValues instead. You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2 data-i18n="index-h2-closest">What does "Closest Match" mean in the results?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-similar">Similar to 8values, this quiz will attempt to match you with a specific rightist ideology. There are currently no ideologies, yet. This is a work in progress and may not work as intended. Suggestions are very welcome. Ideologies are not set up yet, as it is work in process...</p>
<h2 data-i18n="index-h2-scores">I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-scores">Please remember that you are not intended to get a 100% score in any of the categories. The point of the quiz is to challenge your views. If you have any suggestions or constructive criticism please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/6WZYMb5GXkkDLhxr5">short form</a>.</p>
